# Battleship Solitaire Solver üö¢

A Python AI program that solves **Battleship Solitaire puzzles** by formulating them as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** and solving with **backtracking search**, **constraint propagation** (AC-3 / forward checking), and heuristics.

## üìñ About the Project

**Battleship Solitaire** is a logic puzzle inspired by the game Battleship. Unlike the two-player version, a single-player puzzle provides:
- The number of ship parts in each row and column  
- The fleet composition (number of ships of each size)  
- Some squares already revealed as ship parts or water  

The goal is to deduce the exact locations of all ships while following placement rules.  

This solver leverages **CSP techniques** such as:
- **Backtracking Search**
- **Forward Checking / AC-3 Arc Consistency**
- **Heuristics** like Minimum Remaining Values (MRV), Degree Heuristic, and Least Constraining Value (LCV)

## üß© Puzzle Rules Implemented

- Four ship types:
  - Submarines (1√ó1)
  - Destroyers (1√ó2)
  - Cruisers (1√ó3)
  - Battleships (1√ó4)
- Ships are horizontal or vertical only (no diagonals)  
- Ships cannot touch each other, not even diagonally  
- Each row and column must match its ship-part count  
- Some cells may be prefilled with:
  - `S` = submarine  
  - `.` = water  
  - `< >` = ends of a horizontal ship  
  - `^ v` = ends of a vertical ship  
  - `M` = middle part of a ship  
  - `0` = unknown square
